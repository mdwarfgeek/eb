Adaptive Metropolis based EB fitting / Monte Carlo
==================================================

This program is a modified version of the one used for the Irwin et
al. (2011) paper on LSPM J1112+7626, adapted to the new light curve
generator and with a few unneeded bells and whistles removed.  It is
not really intended to be used as-is, but rather as a source of ideas
and implementation hints to borrow from.

A couple of real test data-sets are included:

example1112        The first "non-eclipsed spots on star 1" case from
                   the LSPM J1112+7626 paper, see table 6 and surrounding
                   discussion.

                   The model has evolved quite substantially since the
		   original version used in the paper, so it cannot
		   exactly reproduce the results.

example3236        GJ3236 (Irwin et al. 2009), I and V band only.  The
                   V-band illustrates one of the current limitations,
                   the out of eclipse model is the same across all
                   passbands so doesn't fit the V very well, where the
                   amplitude is expected to be larger.

Both of these come with some shell scripts called "runme" to build the
"ebmc" command lines.  They are set up to just run the
Levenberg-Marquardt and stop, see inside for how to use the Monte
Carlo.

Some notes on how to use it:

The program takes some arcane syntax command-line specifications of
the input and output files.  The parameter inputs are in ascii files.
"modes" 0, 1, 2 for the parameters are as follows.  0: hold the
parameter fixed, 1: vary it in the L-M fit and the Monte Carlo, 2:
hold it fixed in the L-M but vary it in the Monte Carlo.  Some
parameters accept -1 to compute the value from other quantities in the
problem (a particular example is "cltt", the light travel time
constant).  "2" doesn't always work very well because the covariance
matrix isn't properly populated (by the L-M) for these parameters
before the Monte Carlo starts, which can confuse it (see below).

The default setup is to just run a Levenberg-Marquardt and plot the
answers.  My full plotter is included, the first lot are really for
diagnostics, and the last lot were the ones used in the paper.

The -m runs the Monte Carlo simulations.  It is mandatory to give it
an output file to write the simulation output (can be very large, the
2x10^6 point ones in the paper weighed in about 16GB each; I have
thought about changing this to packed binary...) even though the
program doesn't need it, it's done this way to stop me forgetting to
do so.  It then also dumps the output (stuff you want like parameters)
to the .out and plots to the .ps.

Alternatively, you can -l an existing MC file, and it will read it and
then compute the statistics from the posterior samples and make the
plots.  The simulation is not parallel, partly because I didn't need
it (I was running 8 separate chains at a time anyway), and partly
because the Adaptive Metropolis chains are purely sequential - so the
only thing I could really have done would be to compute the light
curve points in parallel (tried this and it didn't seem to help
much).  Metropolis-Hastings and related methods don't suffer from this
restriction.

Input file specification:

Everything is assumed to be a light curve in the "master" filter
unless prefixed with something=.  This filter is the one for which all
the parameters get computed.  My lc1= are the I or V filter curves and
get fit with their own surface brightness ratio J_1 and consequently
also have their own light ratios.  The options after the , are roughly
as follows:

,[number]         specify exposure time in seconds, doing so triggers
                  integration of the model over this exposure time,
                  assuming the given times are midpoint times.  This
                  is not yet supported in the modified program and is
                  currently ignored.  It is not really necessary for
                  most ground-based data.

air (or fitair)   fit an extinction term "k_n*(X-1)" for this LC
cm (or fitcm)     MEarth-specific ("common mode" correction)
err (or fiterr)   fit for (multiplicative) error inflation factor s_n

useair            use the extinction term fit to the first light curve
                  in this filter to correct this light curve, rather
                  than putting in an extra one (this is also fairly
                  specific to what I was doing)
usecm             same for "common mode"

The RVs take a slightly different option set.  Because there is no
good way (that I know of) to estimate errors for TODCOR velocities,
they are estimated from the residuals, and the numbers in the third
column of the input file are the peak correlation values, used to
decide the weights (as described in the paper), if you say "havewt".
They are treated as errors in the normal fashion if you don't say
"havewt".

If fitting for error inflation, you have to say err= to specify the
initial guess of the error (which is the error itself in "havewt"
mode, and is added in quadrature with what it got from the file
otherwise).  This value has to be non-zero due to the way the priors
work.  If you don't know, set to about 1/10 the estimated error.

Other miscellany:

All velocities are in km/s.

Corrections are performed for light travel time across the system
itself (called the Romer delay in the solar system) and for the
Doppler shift of the orbital frequency (often confusingly called
"light travel time" in the literature).  To get the former right, the
program needs to know the physical semimajor axis, so you need radial
velocities.  To get the latter right, the velocities (or gamma
velocity, if given rather than fit) must be Barycentric.

The Adaptive MC can fail in subtle but spectacular ways if the initial
velocity estimates (or some of the other parameters) are way off.
Some of the problems may be due to poor convergence in the Levenberg
Marquardt, giving an incorrect initial covariance matrix.  The initial
parameter estimates should be refined until they are pretty good first
before attempting to use the MC.

For fitting a "normal" number of parameters, I would suggest 10^6
points is a sensible minimum for reliable uncertainties and
correlation plots.  Smaller numbers are okay for testing.

To test convergence visually, I usually just plot the chain.  To
understand the plots, note that the adaptive method is turned on 10%
of the way in, which is visible as a sudden change (hopefully,
improvement) in the rate of exploration of the parameter space.
Samples after 50% of the way through are included in the final
parameter estimates.

Bugs / known problems:

The Monte Carlo output analysis uses a lot of RAM because the entire
data-set is stored.

Handling of fixed parameters during L-M is done internally for
historical reasons.  This is not necessary with MPFIT, which can do
this itself.

I have seen signs of convergence problems in the L-M since I switched
it from levmar to MPFIT.  This can probably be solved by manually
specifying stepsizes on the more troublesome parameters (period and T0
being the most likely suspects).

There could be many more.
